# Biography
Genaina Rodrigues is a tenure professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Brasilia. She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from University College London (2008) in the Software Engineering group. 

Previously, she obtained her bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Brasília in 1999 and her Master's Degree in Computer Science from Federal University of Pernambuco (2002) in the Distributed Systems group.

Her research interests are mostly in Software Systems Engineering including dependability analysis and modeling, self-adaptive systems, goal-oriented requirements engineering, model-driven development for quality requirements, verification of probabilistic models, as well as distributed platforms. 

In 2013, she co-organized the Brazilian Software Engineering Congress (CBSoft) of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC). Together with her research group LADECIC @ LES, she has engaged national and international cooperations in her topics of research interest and has served highly ranked Computer Science journals as well as conferences.
